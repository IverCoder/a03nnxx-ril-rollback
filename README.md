# SMS Fix Magisk Module for Samsung Galaxy A03

A Magisk module that fixes incoming SMS on Galaxy A03 by rolling back the RIL libraries to those from firmware `A035FXXU4CWF3`. This is for the global model (SM-A035F), baseband version `A035FXXU4CWI1` and later.

**⚠️ Do not install this module if you don't have problems receiving texts, or if you are on firmware `A035FXXU4CWF3` or earlier. See the note below if you don't have the global model.**

## Note for Latin American (SM-A035M) and European (SM-A035G) models
This module may be unnecessary for your model and instead prevent the RIL from working at all. You can still try it if you have issues with SMS, and report back to [our Telegram group](https://t.me/a035f) if it works.

## Installation
Download the [latest version](https://github.com/IverCoder/a03nnxx-ril-rollback/releases/latest) and flash it on the Magisk app or a custom recovery.
